# EE559-Deep Learning - Mini-Project 1

Convolutional Neural Networks Performance Assessment to Classify Grayscale Pictures of Two Digits.

### Prerequisites

Make sure that ```Python >= 3.7``` and ```Pytorch >= 1.4``` are installed.

## Script files

### ```models.py```: Implementation of several models: Digit CNN, Comparison CNN, Weight sharing CNN, Siamese CNN, Auxiliary loss CNN
### ```utils.py```: Utility functions to generate datasets, train, evaluate and cross-validate models and compute accuracies.
### ```test.py```: Script to run all the models for several rounds and obtain a performance estimate with test mean and std accuracy.

## Run the project
